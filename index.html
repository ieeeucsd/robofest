									<p>The IEEE Student Branch at UC San Diego has been hosting the California Micromouse 
										and Grand PrIEEE competitions every year around May for the past 8 years and 9 years
										respectively. Both competitions were held in different consecutive weekends and IEEE 
										has helped organize and run the competitions here at UC San Diego. This year, the 
										IEEE student branch would like to combine both project competitions into a single 
										weekend to be a celebration of robotics projects and extend our invitation to students
										not only at UCSD, but students at other schools to create the most premier robotics 
										competition in the region. We would also like to partner with nearby robotics and 
										technology companies in addition to other UCSD student organizations to observe 
										the competition. Robofest is intended to be for students, by students to be a 
										collaborative, fun experience.

							<h2>What is Micromouse?</h2>
							<p>Micromouse is an annual IEEE UCSD event where teams compete with small robot mice in 
								an attempt to be the fastest to solve a 16x16 maze.
							</p>
						</header>
						<p>The California Micromouse competition (CAMM) has been around since its introduction by IEEE in 1977. 
							Our competition today features a 16x16 grid maze and much fiercer competition, as technology has 
							come a long way!

							<h2>What is Grand PRIEEE?</h2>
							<p>Grand PRIEEE is an engineering design competition in which teams compete to build and 
								race small autonomous line-following vehicles.
							</p>
						</header>
						<p>The Grand PrIEEE competition (formerly Viacar) involves following a track consisting of a 
							wire carrying a 100mA rms 75kHz sinusoidal signal taped to the floor. Both the wire and 
							the white tape provide opportunities to track the course, typically via either induction 
							or computer vision. Given that the typical hobbyist remote control car today can achieve 
							significant speed, this makes the ability to optimize a tracking algorithm critical to success.

						<h2>What is RoboCup Soccer: Small Size League?</h2>
						<p>RoboCup is essentially fully autonomous robots playing soccer with two teams and six robots each.
						</p>
					</header>
					<p> The small size league, or F180 league is one of the oldest RoboCup Soccer leagues. We are excited to be
						bringing this competition to Robofest this year. The six robots on each team must adhere to the F180 league
						rules where the robots must fit in a 180mm diameter circle and be no taller than 15cm. Feel free to learn 
						more about RoboCup on their webiste <a href="https://www.robocup.org">here</a>!
