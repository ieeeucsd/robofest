									<p>The IEEE Student Branch at UC San Diego has been hosting the California Micromouse 
										and Grand PrIEEE competitions every year around May for the past 8 years and 9 years
										respectively. Both competitions were held in different consecutive weekends and IEEE 
										has helped organize and run the competitions here at UC San Diego. This year, the 
										IEEE student branch would like to combine both project competitions into a single 
										weekend to be a celebration of robotics projects and extend our invitation to students
										not only at UCSD, but students at other schools to create the most premier robotics 
										competition in the region. We would also like to partner with nearby robotics and 
										technology companies in addition to other UCSD student organizations to observe 
										the competition. Robofest is intended to be for students, by students to be a 
										collaborative, fun experience.

							<h2>What is Micromouse?</h2>
							<p>Micromouse is an annual IEEE UCSD event where teams compete with small robot mice in 
								an attempt to be the fastest to solve a 16x16 maze.
							</p>
						</header>
						<p>The California Micromouse competition (CAMM) has been around since its introduction by IEEE in 1977. 
							Our competition today features a 16x16 grid maze and much fiercer competition, as technology has 
							come a long way!

							<h2>What is Grand PRIEEE?</h2>
							<p>Grand PRIEEE is an engineering design competition in which teams compete to build and 
								race small autonomous line-following vehicles.
							</p>
						</header>
						<p>The Grand PrIEEE competition (formerly Viacar) involves following a track consisting of a 
							wire carrying a 100mA rms 75kHz sinusoidal signal taped to the floor. Both the wire and 
							the white tape provide opportunities to track the course, typically via either induction 
							or computer vision. Given that the typical hobbyist remote control car today can achieve 
							significant speed, this makes the ability to optimize a tracking algorithm critical to success.

						<h2>What is UCSD Robocar?</h2>
						<p>Competitors will race autonomous cars that meet a minimum pre-stabilized performance
							during a competition on an outdoor scaled track simulating city streets.
						</p>
					</header>
					<p> This is the UCSD version of <a href="https://www.meetup.com/DIYRobocars/">DIY Robocars</a>. A track will be setup in an 
						indoor room with a size of 1900 sq ft. It is a space where 1/10 cars can be run indoors and have 
						nearby parking lots where 1/10th scale and go-karts can be raced.  The overall aim of this competition 
						is to make and race pro-level autonomous cars on a budget. That means that they're smaller than 
						regular cars (from go-kart size, down to 1/16th scale) and can be used indoors.
